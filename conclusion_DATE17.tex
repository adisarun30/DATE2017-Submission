\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}
Cloud computing (and other remote computing technology variants such as fog or edge computing) is gaining traction in the automotive domain. To enhance in-vehicle and fault tolerance capabilities of self-driving vehicles, critical control applications can leverage such technologies. In this work, we presented our envisaged offloading controller design that would enable realization of remote resource based control applications. Using a cloud-based path following controller case study, we had demonstrated the feasibility of our approach in the presence of hostile network conditions. 
In the future, this work can be extended to study a more comprehensive control application and quality metrics that would allow us to perform a detailed trade-off analysis between the fully local computation and remote computation approaches. In addition, more hostile network conditions such as packet loss, corrupted packet can be simulated using NS-3 and interfaced with Matlab.
